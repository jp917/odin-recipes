# Odin Recipes
This is a simple project for organizing and displaying recipes using HTML.

## Project Description
The project consists of four iterations, each building on the previous one to create a simple recipe website. The goal is to demonstrate basic HTML skills and project management skills by creating a well-organized and structured website.

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure
Create an index.html file with basic HTML boilerplate code and add an h1 heading with the text "Odin Recipes" to the body.

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
Create a recipes directory and add a new HTML file to it named after a recipe (e.g., lasagna.html). Add an h1 heading with the name of the recipe as its content.

In the index.html file, add a link to the new recipe page using an anchor tag with the href attribute set to recipes/recipename.html.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
Add the following content to the recipe page:

- An image of the finished dish
- A heading labeled "Description" followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe
- A heading labeled "Ingredients" followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe
- A heading labeled "Steps" followed by an ordered list of the steps needed to make the dish

### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
Add two more recipes with the same structure as the first recipe page. Add links to the new recipe pages in the index.html file, and consider putting them in an unordered list for better organization.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic HTML skills, directory management, file naming conventions, linking pages, adding images, headings, paragraphs, and lists, as well as basic project management skills.

## Getting Started
